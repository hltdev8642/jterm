### Live Coding (Phone) Interview Demo

- **Notes**
	- In a live (shared) google doc.
	- Use courier new font for coding
	- Have pen/paper ready for notes
	- Configure for coding, as best as you can in gDocs settings
	- Have cell phone/computer charged, so it doesn't die out mid-interview

### Interview Assessment Goals
- **Skills:**
	- What you will see:
		- Data Structures and Algorithms
		- Problem Solving and Analytical Skills
		- Code Understanding
		- Communication
	- What you wont see:
		- Brain Teasers, Puzzles, or Trick Questions
		- 
- **Topics:**
	- Coding:
		- The core concepts of your chosen language:
			- Functions
			- Classes
			- Types
	- Algorithms:
		- Runtime Analysis
		- Recursion
		- Sorting
		- Searching
		- Traversals
	- Data Structures:
		- Lists
		- Stacks
		- Queues
		- Trees
		- Graphs
		- Sets
		- Maps

- **important considerations:**
	- How did the candidate analyze the problem
	- Did candidate miss any specific or edge cases
	- Did candidate approach problem methodologically and logically?
	- Did candidate have strong foundation in basic computer science concepts?
	- Did can prod work code? did test?
	- Is candidate's code clean easy to read maintain.
	- Can candidate explain their idea(s) clearly?
	- Is the candidate (a) positive (person) to work with?

- **Communication and presentation:**
	- Verbalize your thoughts
		- Restate q to confirm und
		- Ask clear questions
		- Think out loud
		- Draw Pictures
	- Listen to your interviewer

- **Tips:**
	- Don't "jump into" coding immediately.

- **Examples / Testing:**
	- Discuss testing verbally first
	- Pick a simple example
	- Think about an edge case or two
	- Analyze complexity (runtime & space)

- **Common Mistakes:**
	- Not writing real code
		- If agreed upon by interviewer . . .
			- Use pseudocode to communicate initial thinking
			- Use "helper" functions (think unimplemented functions, not pseudocode)
		- Dont . . .
			- Use pseudocode in your solution
			- Mix real code with pseudocode
- Premature Optimization:
	- Instead . . .
		- Think critically about the algorithmic complexity of your solution
		- Explain why it is/isn't possible to improve complexity
	- Don't . . .
		- Assume brute force is unacceptable 

- **How to prepare before your interview:**
	- Review the fundamentals
	- Practice your strongest coding language
	- Practice in a shared doc/whiteboard with a friend
	- If you need accommodations, let your recruiter know in advance

- **Final Tips:**
	- There are no shortcuts; practice practice practice!
	- Err on the side of over-communicating
	- Test your code!
	- Don't panic. You know your stuff!
